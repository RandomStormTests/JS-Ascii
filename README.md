Javascript Technical Test
=============

Here at RandomStorm we like to give interesting challanges for technical tests, we are not a company that solves normal problems; so why should we give you a normal technical test?

This test comes in two parts. Firstly, we would like you to answer some questions about JavaScript - this will give us a good idea of your level of knowledge of JS. Our entire frontend is based off JavaScript, so we utilize it heavily on the client, and are beginning to do more so on the server side as well, so a very good knoweldge of JavaScript is required for all of our “frontend” roles.

* Step 1: [Questions](tests/Questions.md) 
* Step 2: [The ASCII art test](tests/AsciiArt.md)

Once you have completed both of those, pack up your answers and your test response and send it to the person who sent you the link to get here :)
