Javascript Technical Test
=============

Here at RandomStorm we like to give interesting challenges for technical tests, we are not a company that solves normal problems; so why should we give you a normal technical test?

This test comes in two parts. Firstly, we would like you to answer some questions about JavaScript - this will give us a good idea of your level of knowledge of JS.

Our client application is built from JavaScript, and we are beginning to do more so on the server side as well, so a very good knowledge of JavaScript is required for all of our “front-end” roles.

* Part 1: [Questions](tests/Questions.md) 
* Part 2: [The ASCII art test](tests/AsciiArt.md)

Once you have completed both of those, pack up your answers and your test response and send it to the person who sent you the link to get here!
